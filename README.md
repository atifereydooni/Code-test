## Functionality

- Present the restaurants fetched from the API in a list.

- Fetch filters and present them in a horizontal list, pressing a filter item which should alter the restaurant list so it only shows restaurants with that tag. Multiple filters can be selected at the same time.

The project is developed in the Kotlin language and also uses libraries such as Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Coil, and Retrofit. The JUnit and Mockk test libraries were used for unit testing.

Multi-module using Clean Architecture alongside other components and MVVM architectural design patterns are used for project architecture.

###ToDo
Extra needed for the implementation by more time:
The tests are not complete and should be more completed
The app should be tested on more devices and latest android versions
